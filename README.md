StreamingContentTracker
================

![Example of App Picture](https://github.com/RonaldGRowe/StreamingContentTracker/blob/master/Images/tracker-image.png)

The ability to keep track of all the shows you have watched 
and the ones you haven't.
Using C# and Windows forms.
Storing information in text files.

I'm always trying to remember which shows I had watched.
Which shows were terrible.
Which ones I looked forward to watching.
I came up with the idea to track this information.
This was a fun project after I came up with the idea.
# Accomplished
- It linked multiple forms.
- Allowed multiple users.
- Contained a URL link to a movie info website.
- Had an edit feature to add additional seasons and episodes.

Unfortunately, the projects had to be completed using Windows forms.
It would have been great to have it on a mobile platform.
Again an earlier project with the sole focus to finish.
# Issues
- Lack of comments
- Variable naming
- Readability
